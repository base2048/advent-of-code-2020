## [AoC 2020 Day 10: Adapter Array](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/10)

A little bit of this, a little bit of that, and soon you get 2376 jolts out of a 0 jolt generator. You think this is magic? Not at all, it's pure maths.

For part two a cache was implemented - after all, we have no time to lose snatching some free jolts.

Maybe the JUnit tests could be designed a little better, but hey - free jolts...
